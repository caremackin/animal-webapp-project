# Animal Webapp

## Overview

This full-stack application was developed to provide an interactive and dynamic platform for displaying funny animal content. 

The project integrates: 
* Angular on the front end
* Node.js on the backend
* A Sqlite database to hold animal information.

I built this project to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Node.js, and SQL. 

## Features

- **Interactive Content Display:** The frontend is handled by **Angular** and **Angular Material UI**, allowing the user to select an animal and view a funny photo and description of it.

- **Animal Info Retreival:** The backend is powered by **Node.js**. Every time the user selects an animal, real-time data is retrieved via the **SQLite** database. 

- **Secure HTTPS Communication:** The client-server communication is secured through HTTPS.
